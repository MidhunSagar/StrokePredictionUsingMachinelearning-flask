# StrokePredictionUsingMachinelearning-flask
A machine learning Flask app to predict stroke risk with explainability
# ðŸ§  Stroke Prediction System using Machine Learning and Flask

This project is a real-time web application that predicts the risk of a stroke based on clinical and lifestyle inputs. Built using a trained Logistic Regression model with SMOTE for class balancing and deployed using a Flask web framework, this system also incorporates explainable AI to show users why the prediction was made.

## ðŸ§ª Machine Learning Pipeline

- Preprocessing with `ColumnTransformer`
  - `OneHotEncoder` for categorical variables
  - `OrdinalEncoder` for smoking status
- Class imbalance handled using **SMOTE**
